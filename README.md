# Coding guidelines for project

*A mostly reasonable approach to `JAVASCRIPT` and `React` and rules and that follow in `SARA`*

This style guide is mostly based on the standards that are currently prevalent in JavaScript and we have to follow 
in our project, although some conventions (i.e async/await, naming files)

## Basic Rules

  - Only include one React component per file.
    - However, multiple [Stateless, or Pure, Components](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html#stateless-functions) 
    are allowed per file.
  - Always use JSX syntax In `React.JS` and use JS syntax in `React Native` for files.
